# TouK Cinema Manager 1.0.0-release

### Building and running

I have included a .bat script that will build the app for you (you must have Maven installed).

To run the app, please copy the run.bat and touk_cinema.db to the directory containing the .jar (probably called target).

If something goes wrong with compiling please use the precompiled jars available in the releases tab of this github project.

### Remarks

* There are no booked seats in the cinema at the time of the demonstration. (I have not spent time randomly generating or reserving seats).

* You cannot use polish signs in any console input (but the program handles polish signs from other sources correctly).

* I don't have any experience with REST, but after some research was able to expose my methods to REST, although they probably won't work if you hook them up to a web client. (Sorry)

* The entire demo is conducted via console input and output. If you wanted something else then please write an e-mail and i'll try to rewrite.

* For detailed information about the app's inner transactions enable debug in the App Class, and recompile.

I hope it's up to your expectations
And that we'll make a great team in the future
